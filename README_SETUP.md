# ðŸš€ ActionInbox - Universal Setup Guide

**Get ActionInbox working for ANYONE in 3 minutes!**

## ðŸŽ¯ The Problem
Google OAuth requires app verification for public use. This means users get "access denied" errors when trying to use ActionInbox.

## âœ… The Solution
Each user creates their own FREE Google Cloud project. This bypasses all restrictions and gives full access.

python setup_wizard.py
```

- Opens web pages automatically
- Creates configuration files
- Works for everyone

### Option 2: Super Quick Setup
```bash
python quick_setup.py
```
- Automated setup with minimal interaction
- Opens Google Cloud Console
- Waits for you to download credentials
- Creates basic configuration

### Option 3: Manual Setup (5 minutes)

#### Step 2: Enable Gmail API
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/gmail.googleapis.com

#### Step 3: Create OAuth Credentials

4. Application type: "Desktop application"
5. Name: "ActionInbox Desktop"
6. Click "Create"
7. Download JSON file
8. Rename to `credentials.json`
9. Move to ActionInbox folder
